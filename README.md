# Colored Candy
![Colored Candy Preview](Attachments/colored-candy-combined-preview-2.png)

This is a cute lil' theme for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that changes the interface colors based off of your chosen accent color.

You can choose your accent color in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) under **Settings → Appearance → Accent color**.

This theme will change the **background colors** according to your accent color's **hue**, and create **two *new* psuedo accent colors** with their hues **offset** from the original, and calculating their saturation and lightness from the original.

If you see anything that looks broken and needs fixing, please create an [issue](https://github.com/Erallie/colored-candy/issues) so that I know to fix it.

> **PLEASE NOTE:** This theme is *intentionally* low-contrast. However, I will try to keep this theme accessibility-friendly as best I can. If anything is too difficult for you to read, create an [issue](https://github.com/Erallie/colored-candy/issues), and I'll see what I can do.
